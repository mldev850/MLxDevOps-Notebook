 Credentials 
 🔐 Jenkins Credentials: Secure Your Secrets

Jenkins manages sensitive information using the **credentials store**. This is where you securely keep:
- Passwords & API Keys 🔑
- Certificates & SSH Keys 📜
- Secret Texts & Tokens 🕵️‍♂️

 ⚡ Best Practices for Managing Credentials:
✅ Never Hardcode Secrets: Use the credentials store instead.  
✅ Use Plugins for Cloud Credentials: If using AWS, install `AWS Credentials Plugin`.  
✅ ID Naming Matters: Always use no spaces in credential IDs.  
✅ Restrict Access: Assign minimal permissions using Jenkins security settings.  

When you install a plugin like AWS Credentials, it appears in the credential type dropdown. This makes it easy to manage cloud-based secrets securely
